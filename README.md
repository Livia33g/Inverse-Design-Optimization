# yield-optimization-tool
The Yield Optimization Tool maximizes the yield of target structures in entropy-driven self-assembly systems. By optimizing parameters like interaction strengths and concentrations, it enhances assembly precision. Using gradient-based methods, the tool balances entropic factors for high yield at equilibrium, leveraging JAX and HOOMD-Blue.
